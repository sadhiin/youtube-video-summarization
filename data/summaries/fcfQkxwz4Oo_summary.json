  "summary": "Brian Cox explains the rules of quantum mechanics using Feynman's version.\nHe states that particles hop from place to place with a particular probability.\nThe probability is given by a simple rule using a quantity called the action.\nThe action is related to the mass of the particle, time, and distance.\nTo calculate the probability, you assign a quantity to every point in space.\nYou then add up these quantities to find the probability of a particle moving.\nThis is called the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics.\nIt underlies all other principles of quantum mechanics, making it a fundamental concept.\nCox explains that with this simple rule, you can determine the probability of a particle moving from A to B.\nHe successfully explains the rules of quantum mechanics within a minute, using straightforward language.",
  "transcript_text": " Brian Cox, without hesitation, repetition or deviation, can you please explain for us as succinctly as possible? I have a timer here. The rules of quantum mechanics. Your time starts now. Well, the most basic version I know of is Feynman's version, which essentially says particles are particles and they hop from place to place with a particular probability. And the probability that a particle that's at some place will be at some different place later is given by a very simple rule and it uses a quantity called the action which is to do with the mass of the particle and the time and the distance and you so you basically calculate these little uh quantities which are to do with something called the action and you add them up so if i start with an electron in one corner of the room and i say what's the probability at some time later it'll be somewhere else then at every point in the room you can assign a probability that it will be there at a later point with one simple rule and that's it. Now this is called the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. That underlies everything else. You can get the rest from that. So it's a simple rule. So what's the probability a particle will move from A to B? That's it. I'll stop the timer then. Very good. Well, under a minute.",
